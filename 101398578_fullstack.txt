Front-End Development:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language for creating web pages.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used for styling the HTML elements, providing layout and design to web pages.
JavaScript: A programming language that enables interactive web pages. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are commonly used for building dynamic UIs.
Responsive Design: Ensures web applications work well on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
Back-End Development:

Server: Manages client requests and sends back responses, usually involving business logic and database interactions.
Programming Languages: Common languages include Node.js (JavaScript), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Ruby on Rails), Java (Spring), and PHP.
Databases: Used to store application data. Two main types:
SQL Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL): Structured data with predefined schemas.
NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra): Flexible data models, typically for unstructured data.
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

RESTful APIs: Common architecture style for building web services, allowing front-end and back-end communication.
GraphQL: An alternative to REST that enables clients to request only the data they need.
DevOps:

Version Control: Tools like Git are essential for tracking code changes.
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment): Practices for automating the deployment process and ensuring code quality.
Containerization: Using tools like Docker to manage application deployment and scalability.
Full Stack Development Workflow
Planning: Define project scope, requirements, and user stories.
Design: Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
Front-End Development: Build the client-side of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks.
Back-End Development: Implement the server-side logic, set up the database, and create RESTful APIs.
Testing: Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
Deployment: Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean) to deploy the application.
Maintenance: Regularly update and maintain the application to ensure security and performance.
Full Stack Developer Roles
Full Stack Developer: A versatile developer who can handle both front-end and back-end tasks.
Front-End Developer: Focuses on creating the visual aspects of the application.
Back-End Developer: Specializes in server-side programming and database management.
DevOps Engineer: Works on the infrastructure, deployment, and operations side of the applications.
