Key Stakeholders:
- **End Users**: The primary users who will interact with the software.
- **Clients**: Individuals or organizations that fund the project and have specific requirements.
- **Project Managers**: Responsible for overseeing the project and ensuring it meets deadlines and budgets.
- **Developers**: The technical team that builds the software.
