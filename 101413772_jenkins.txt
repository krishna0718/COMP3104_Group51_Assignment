Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are made easier by Jenkins, an open-source automation server. It is an essential tool in the DevOps pipeline since it automates the development, testing, and deployment of applications. Jenkins is very adaptable to different project requirements because it supports a large number of plugins that enable integration with different tools and technologies.
