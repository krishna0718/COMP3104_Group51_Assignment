Two key DevOps techniques that automate the integration and production deployment of code changes are Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). While CD automates the deployment of tested changes, CI makes sure that newly merged code is automatically tested. When combined, they allow for dependable and quick software releases, which lowers the need for manual intervention and raises the standard of software overall.
