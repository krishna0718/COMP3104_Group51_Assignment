In DevOps, version control systems such as Git are crucial for managing collaboration, keeping track of code revisions, and tracking changes. Teams can work on various project components simultaneously, merge changes effectively, and revert to earlier iterations when needed thanks to version control. It guarantees that every code modification is tracked down and can be handled centrally within the CI/CD process.
