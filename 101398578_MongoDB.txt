What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a flexible, document-oriented data model. It allows for high scalability and performance, making it a preferred choice for modern web applications.

Key Features
Document-Oriented Storage:

Data is stored in JSON-like documents (BSON - Binary JSON), which can have varying structures. This allows for flexibility in how you design your database schema.
Schema Flexibility:

Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed schema. You can easily add new fields to documents without affecting existing documents.
High Performance:

MongoDB provides high performance for both reads and writes. It supports indexing, allowing you to quickly retrieve documents based on specified fields.
Scalability:

MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability. It can easily scale out by sharding data across multiple servers, making it suitable for large datasets.
Rich Query Language:

MongoDB supports a powerful query language that allows for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data. It can perform complex queries with ease.
Replication:

MongoDB supports replication, allowing you to maintain multiple copies of your data across different servers for redundancy and high availability.
Aggregation Framework:

MongoDB has a built-in aggregation framework that allows for data processing and transformation, making it easier to perform calculations and generate reports.
Geospatial Queries:

MongoDB has support for geospatial data, allowing you to perform location-based queries and calculations.
MongoDB Data Model
Database: A container for collections.
Collection: A group of related documents, analogous to a table in relational databases.
Document: A single record in a collection, stored in BSON format.
Basic Commands
Here are some basic MongoDB commands to get you started:

Connect to a Database:

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
Define a Schema:

javascript
Copy code
const { Schema } = mongoose;

const userSchema = new Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
    age: Number
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
Create a Document:

javascript
Copy code
const newUser = new User({ name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com', age: 30 });
newUser.save().then(() => console.log('User saved!'));
Query Documents:

javascript
Copy code
User.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } }).then(users => console.log(users));
Update a Document:

javascript
Copy code
User.updateOne({ email: 'john@example.com' }, { age: 31 }).then(() => console.log('User updated!'));
Delete a Document:

javascript
Copy code
User.deleteOne({ email: 'john@example.com' }).then(() => console.log('User deleted!'));
Tools for MongoDB
MongoDB Compass: A GUI for MongoDB that allows you to visualize and manipulate your data.
MongoDB Atlas: A cloud database service that provides managed MongoDB instances, with built-in features for scalability, security, and backup.
Use Cases
MongoDB is commonly used in various applications, including:

Content Management Systems (CMS)
Real-time analytics
Internet of Things (IoT) applications
